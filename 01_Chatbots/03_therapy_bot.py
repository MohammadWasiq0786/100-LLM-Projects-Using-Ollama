"""
Project 3. Therapy Bot with Empathetic Tone

Description:
This project builds a supportive, non-judgmental chatbot designed to simulate a virtual therapy session. 
The bot listens, responds with empathy, and encourages self-reflection. 
It doesnâ€™t provide clinical advice but acts as a kind listener using an empathetic prompt style. 
Perfect for practicing tone, prompt design, and emotional intelligence in LLMs.

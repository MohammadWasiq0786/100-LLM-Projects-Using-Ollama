Project 10. Roleplay Bot (‚ÄúPretend You‚Äôre a Chef‚Äù)

Description:
This project creates a chatbot that roleplays as a specific character. In this example, 
the AI pretends to be a world-class chef who teaches you how to cook, gives you recipes, answers food questions, and 
shares kitchen tips‚Äîall with personality and flair. You can customize it to pretend to be anyone (doctor, pirate, wizard, etc.).

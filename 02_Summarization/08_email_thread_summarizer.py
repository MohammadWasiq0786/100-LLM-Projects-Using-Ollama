"""
Project 18. Email Thread Summarizer

Description:
This tool summarizes long, back-and-forth email threads into a concise overviewâ€”highlighting who said what, 
key decisions, and action items. Itâ€™s perfect for busy professionals who need to catch up on emails quickly without 
reading everything line by line.

"""
Project 93. Style Transfer Prompt (e.g., rewrite as Shakespeare)

Description:
This app rewrites your input text in a completely different styleâ€”like Shakespearean drama, pirate slang, Gen Z speak, or even Yoda talk. 
Itâ€™s a fun way to experiment with tone, voice, and creative prompt engineering.
